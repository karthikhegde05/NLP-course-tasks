# NLP course tasks

The repo contains projects done in the NLP course (Jan 2021 - April 2021)

## Character Level BIO Named Entity Recognition

Trained BIO based RNN model treating character as training instance. The Performance of the character RNN model is compared with the word level BIO RNN model.

> Technologies used: Tensorflow, Keras

## NLP based parser

NLP parser is built on a subset of english sentences related to IIITB academics. The parser is based on the context-free grammar whose production rules and terminals are given in [Grammar.lark](https://github.com/karthikhegde05/NLP-course-tasks/blob/main/NLP-based-parser/Grammar.lark)
